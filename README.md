# Progressive Software

Progressive Software is  about  freedom.  Not  only the freedom of its
users or developers, but for the whole society.

A software cannot  be  truly  free  if  it allows users, developers or
corporations  to  harm  anyhow  other  people - specially the  already
excluded minorities.

There cannot be freedom  while  the  freedom  is just for few, and for
that, ethical software must  also  be progressive - bring not only the
source and the  knowledge  for  society  but  also  make it helps with
society progress.

# A Collective Construction

We are constructing the draft of  a license inspired on AGPL, ensuring
ensuring software licensed with  it  protects society as whole, beyond
just the users, the developers and the companies around the project.

# A Work in Progress
